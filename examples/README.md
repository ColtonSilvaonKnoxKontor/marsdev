## Example Projects

### SGDK Skeleton
An SGDK sample program based on the moon tutorial.
It can be used as a starting point for SGDK projects.

### SGDK SSF Mapper
An example of using SGDK 1.50+ "Far" data feature, 
a bank switching enhancement that allows the use of ROMs greater than 4MB in size.
Make sure you have "libmd-far.a" in $(MARSDEV)/elf-m68k/lib.

### MD Skeleton
A barebones program that prints Hello World.
Can be used as a starting point for people who want to do it all themself,
rather than use SGDK.

### 32X Skeleton
Barebones 32X program, based on [ammianus's example](https://github.com/ammianus/32xHomebrew).

### Echo Test
Test ROM for Echo's C API.

### Sonic
Builds the Sonic disassembly (converted to GNU syntax). Don't tell Sega.

### Stage9 Sample
An example program for a map editor I made. Should really finish it someday.
The graphics came from OpenGameArt ([details](sgdk-stage9-sample/res/resources.res))
