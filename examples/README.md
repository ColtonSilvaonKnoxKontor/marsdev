## Example Projects

### Echo Test
Test ROM for Echo's C API.

### Sonic
Builds the Sonic disassembly (converted to GNU syntax). Don't tell Sega.

### Stage9 Sample
An example program for a map editor I made. Should really finish it someday.
The graphics came from OpenGameArt ([details](sgdk-stage9-sample/res/resources.res))
